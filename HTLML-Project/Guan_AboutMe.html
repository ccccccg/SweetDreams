      <p>My name is Carina and I am a freshman in Dublin High School. I chose Computer Science Principles for my elective because I wanted to learn something new and challenge myself with a new topic. I am also hoping to be able to apply these skills to the future.
      <br><br>
      I am still unsure on the exact job I want to work in. However, I do I know I want to work in the field of forensics or criminal justice. This is because I want to help bring justice and make the world a better, safer place to live in.
      <br><br>
      I grew up being an older sister, which led me to take care of and guide my younger sister for the majority of my life. This helped me develop leadership skills and a passion for helping kids and people in need of help. I also took leadership classes in both seventh and eigth grade. Another skill I possess is organization. Organization helps me focus and make me feel better about myself. I am also determined. If I start a project or start to do something, I will not stop until it is done. If there is an obstacle in the way, I look for other ways to get around it to reach my goal.
      <br><br>
      I have volunteered to pack food for the non profit organization Kids Against Hunger. In Kids Against Hunger (KAH), you pack food that contain necessary food nutrients and vitamins and ship them to places suffering from hunger. I also have worked multiple times in Baskin Robbins over the summer and during my freetime.
      <br><br>
      I started playing the piano when I was six years old and stopped when I was was around twelve. I also have played the violin and guitar. I started horseback riding in fifth grade and I still am. I am currently working on getting into horseback riding competitions.
       <br><br>
       During quarantine, I have continued my interest in forensics and criminal justice. I am reading books, textbooks, and biographies about forensic science/scientists and what they do.
