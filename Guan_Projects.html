<!--Description of Scratch Project-->
      <p><strong>PLTW Computer Science Principles</strong>
      <br> <br>
     The Scratch Project was a project our class was assigned to make in Computer Science. The objective was to create a game that included user interaction. To acheive this, my partner and I made a simple multiplayer shooting game. Users can pick their gamemode and the characters they want to play as. The outcome of the game also depends on what the user does. You can <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/327647877/" target="_blank"> visit and play the game here</a></p>

      <h4>MIT App Inventor Project</h4>
      <p><strong>PLTW Computer Science Principles</strong>
      <br> <br>
      This project was made on MIT App Inventor. The goal was to create an app based off of an existing one and customize it. The app we made is called "Where's my Car". When you park your car, you have to click on "save location" and your location and coordinates will save. When you want to return to your car again, you just can click on "Show Directions" and it leads to Google Maps and directions. You can click on the help button if you are confused about something. Clicking on the red marker leads you to a live map to show your location. You can choose whether you want the satellite mode on or off. When we were making this app, we learned about how to use location sensors.

      I made this project on repl.it using Python. In this project, we had to take different pictures and edit them using Python for a "client". Since I chose the family client, I had to edit images that you would see inside of a house that a family would use. In this project, I learned how to use and edit frames, and I got more confident with maksing images.
